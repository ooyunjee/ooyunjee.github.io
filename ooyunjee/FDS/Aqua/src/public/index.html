        <h2>Water — one of the most amazing substances in nature</h2>
        <p>
          It is well known that life on Earth originated due
to the presence of water. In the water, life began,
out of it, gradually repopulating the land and the air.
The water forms a water shell of our planet —
the hydrosphere from the Greek words "hydro" — water, "sphere" — the ball. Water occupies three-quarters of the surface. In nature, it filled
the oceans cup, sea, lakes, rivers, swamps. There
are artificial reservoirs to store water — ponds, reservoirs and canals. Water is also in the depths
of the Earth and its atmosphere.
        </p>
        <q>It is therefore impossible to find in nature "clean" water, that is water which is not dissolved in any substance.</q>
